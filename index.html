                for 10+ hours (sometimes I was tired, but not him!!) is something one didn't find in many jee
                teachers. He not only taught me mathematics but how to attempt the jee exam as a whole, and that was
                the most important skill that I learned from him. Apart from studies, our occasional "food bets" (I
                usually lose them 😢) and then party with everyone is something one can only find at innovation

                times of my life.
                Although I spent only one year after class 12th, I created a really good bond with my Mentor and
                Teacher Mr Samir Kumar Jha sir.
                Dear sir, I really enjoyed having you as a teacher. I learned so much from you. Thanks for all that
                you did and for making learning fun. Thank you for creating such a great environment to learn and
                where we were encouraged to express our own thoughts and opinions.
                I still remember staying at the centre the whole day, it almost became my second home. Studying while
                having fun is something I learnt here.
                Not only was the teaching both fun and challenging, but Sir's direct feedback for improving my skills
                and knowledge to solve questions and understanding concepts was invaluable</p>
